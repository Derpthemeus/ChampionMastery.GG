#ChampionMasteryLookup
This is the source code for [ChampionMasteryLookup](http://championmasterylookup.derpthemeus.com)



#Setup
This section is if you want to host your own version of the website. If you just want to use it, check out the [live version](http://championmasterylookup.derpthemeus.com)

The live website is hosted on [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/), so if you want to host your own site thats the easiest way to do it.
It uses the Node.js 0.10 cartridge and requires the RIOT_API_KEY environment variable to be set to a Riot API key. If you don't have a key, you can easily get one from the [Riot developer website](https://developer.riotgames.com/).



#Notes
The code has very few comments and my be hard to understand. I don't have much experience working with Javascript, so I'm sure there are plenty of amateur mistakes.
Feel free to make a pull request or open an issue if you want to add or improve anything.

Also, I don't like documenting stuff, so there isn't much info in this README

#License
Licensed under the "Do whatever you want as long as you're not a dick license".
Everything I know about Javascript I learned from the internet and playing around with other peoples' code. I want everyone to have the same opportunity I did, so feel free to modify the code as much as you want and host your own version of the website as long as you're not a dick. Examples of dickish behavior include:

* Claiming content made by others to be your own
* Taking advantage of exploits you find
* Destroying the world
